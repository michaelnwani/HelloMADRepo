   <string name="about_text">\
Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle.
Starting with a partially completed 9x9 grid, the
objective is to fill the grid so that each
row, each column, and each of the 3x3 boxes
(also called <i>blocks</i>) contains the digits
1 to 9 exactly once.

    <string name="trickiest_part_text">\
        The trickiest part of the project to construct that makes us think \"are we going to be able to do that?\" is setting up the connection between players through their contacts (i.e. their friends list). Essentially how we\'re thinking this will work is: \n
        1) When a player opens the app, using ContactsContract.Profile (and the "READ_PROFILE", "READ_CONTACTS" permissions), \n
        we store their display_name (unique to their phone) in a database (Parse at this point). It\'s viable because this app could only be downloaded \n
        from the Google Play Store, for which they need an account.\n
        2) When a user clicks on the menu button to go to their friends board, we\'re constructing it so that we pull from their contacts list and \n
        cross-examine the contact names with the display names gathered previously. Those results will be the only \"friends\" we display in a dialog. \n
        (we may store phone numbers instead because they\'re very highly unique, but I thought this would do for demonstration purposes).\n
        3) When a user taps on a friend in the ListView-like structure result, they\'ll be taken to that friends food board, i.e. pulling lots of data from \n
        a database that simulates the appearance of \"travelling to their friends board\".</string>
